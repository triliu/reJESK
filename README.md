The reJESK, a redox-inspired 70-switch ortholinear keyboard that uses a new diode-free design.

The diode-free design is easy for first-time keyboard makers, as it reduces the complexity and length of time to make your own board. This keyboard is part of the geometric diode-free keyboard project, which is creating keyboards with great key rollover characteristics without using diodes. Other keyboards released previously are the [Heawood42](https://github.com/triliu/Heawood42) (A 21*2-key split ortholinear board, with 21 keys per 14 GPIO) and the [JESK56](https://github.com/triliu/JESK56) (A 56-key monobody ortholinear board, with 56 keys using 28 GPIO). 

The diode-free design comes from a modification of the JESK graph, which was used in the [JESK56 keyboard](https://github.com/triliu/JESK56) to yield a 56-switch keyboard using 28 GPIO without diodes. This has been placed together with a design that is inspired by the [redox keyboard](https://github.com/mattdibi/redox-keyboard). The JESK graph was found by Exoo, Kolokolnikov, Janssen, Salamon; see their [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07308) or [final publication](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jgt.23146?af=R)
