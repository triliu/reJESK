# reJESK
Repository for the reJESK keyboard. The reJESK keyboard is a 70-switch ortholinear keyboard that uses a new diode-free design, and so is easy for first-time keyboard makers.

The diode-free design comes from a modification of the JESK graph, which was used in the JESK56 keyboard (https://github.com/triliu/JESK56) to yield a 56-switch keyboard without diodes. This has been placed together with a design that is inspired by the redox keyboard (https://github.com/mattdibi/redox-keyboard).
